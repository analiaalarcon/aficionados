          ¿Who organizes the Swim? <span>+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Since 1964, the AMARC has been the organizing body of the Santa Fe-Coronda International Swim. <br>
            The same association is in charge of organizing this event for amateur swimmers, ensuring its performance under the same standards of safety and respect for this historic event.  <br>

          ¿Is this swim a competition? <span>+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The main objective of this new mode is “swimming the Santa Fe-Coronda”. The main challenge is completing the swim. <br>
          Even though the time will be recorded and the swimmers who complete the course will be recognized, the essence of the event is not competitive but rather experiential and for personal  fulfillment.

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p> Duration depends on three factors: <br>
          1.	Weather conditions on the day of the event. <br>
          2.	The river’s height, which has an influence on the speed of the current. <br>
          3.	The swimming pace of the solo swimmer or team. <br>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Throughout the course it is swum downstream, which helps the swimmer's progress. The average river speed is 4 km/h (2.5 mph) The current is not a risk for the swimmer but an aid.</p>
